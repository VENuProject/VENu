New TODO
- - - -
A list of things I’ve noticed that I’d like to see changed/improved.
Not all are necessary and not in order of importance.
-: WIP
+: done

[ ]1. Make the event buttons look nicer - maybe find a new way to display names?
[ ]2. Review the events we have to make sure they’re pretty
[ ]3. Add a few more events of various sizes
[ ]4. Would be nice to merge the various camera controls, so the view doesn’t jump around when switching. Do we really need a separate object for each?
[+]5. Minimap mode isn’t affected by MoveSpeed slider
[ ]6. Minimap mode rotation speed is very slow. Increase slider values?
[+]7. Pretty up ingame menu.
[ ]8. Will we need a demo mode of some sort, with certain features disabled?
